    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Tonight I attended a Meetup about web design process and strategy. Am I a designer? Only fledgling. Am I a part of the community? No but I am trying to be. Why then would I even try to attend a meet up about design? Why would I subject myself to the awkwardness of explaining that "No am I not a designer. I'm not even a web developer yet." It's a scary prospect attending a community meet up in a community you have no real connection to.  Before I go into the reason and explanation of why I am doing these things, lets dive into a bit of a thought experiment.</p>

<p>Your crazy idea</p>

<p>Lets say that you have this crazy idea. The idea is very different from every idea that you have had in the past. Odds are the idea is vague, the implementation is challenging and you don't have the skills to start. However you are convinced this the idea is worth pursuing. If only you could gather the skills, the knowledge and the motivation to do it yourself. How would you go about pursuing this idea?</p>

<p>In language studies I read that to truly know and understand a new language you have to be immersed in that language. Your day to day routines have to be in that language. Your ideas and frustrations have to be expressed in that language. Only then will you be able to communicate with people speaking that language. Most of the time language students travel to the region where they can live the language, where everyone around them speaks the language. Why don't we learn all new skills the same way? If you are a plumber you need to be immersed in plumbing (sigh unintentional pun). If you are a locksmith you better understand all the different kinds of locks. If you are a web designer or developer you need to know how people design for the web.</p>

<p>My crazy idea</p>

<p>My goal is to learn web design and web development. I am immersing myself in the world and I am trying to fully understand what it means to be a web designer/developer. </p>

<p>Immersion Creation</p>

<p>How do we create this immersive atmosphere when we cannot just travel to a foreign land? My current idea is to fill as much of my life with web dev and design as possible. I want to speak web dev, sleep web dev, and who knows <a href="http://www.meetup.com/TechBreakfast/">eat</a> web dev. When I am not working my day job I am working on Thinkful coursework. When I am walking to work I am listening to web dev/design podcasts like <a href="http://shoptalkshow.com/">Shoptalk Show</a>. I bookmark articles about web dev/design to read later. I follow and keep up with designers in the community via twitter. I attend Meetup groups and conferences about web deb/design. I am fully integrating this work into my life and I believe if you want to tackle that project or idea you have, you need to do the same.</p>

<p>The Web Community</p>

<p>Luckily in the web design and web development community there are talented people that are willing to teach other potentially talented people their craft. The Web community is taking all of the benefits of the old trade/apprenticeship model and tweaking it for today's internet filled world. Through the use of Meetup groups and Twitter we can connect with smart people in the community and we can pick their brains to gather critical knowledge about our work. In the web community it is almost required that the most experienced members teach their craft. In DC groups like <a href="http://refresh-dc.org/">RefreshDC</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/washdctech/#">DC Tech</a> encourage participation by all and create fun learning events for the DC web community. DC design and development agencies like <a href="http://istrategylabs.com/">iStrategyLabs</a> are also fully involved in teaching others their skills. I believe the companies see it as a way to build and eventually procure the most talented members of the community. Win, win. </p>

<p>Realism</p>

<p>In the end we'll see if my efforts will help me meet my goal of joining the web dev/design community. We have to be realistic when thinking of the outcome of our efforts. I have set my goal as a challenge but I also have to be happy if I only attain parts of the goal. If at the very least I come out of this journey with a basic understanding of the web dev/develop world, I will still be able to apply my new knowledge to other projects and goals. Again, win, win.</p>

<p>Thinkful update</p>

<p>I am working hard on finishing up a first draft on my personal site.  It is clear now that designing is a process where iteration is key. The first project I really designed, <a href="http://blog.albino-squirrel.com/blog/2013/04/20/wmata-nextbus-redesign/">WMATA Redesign</a>, was a struggle. While I don't think I have the best design I do think it is a step in the right direction. For my personal site I am taking all the knowledge I have gained of the 'design process' and I have started to formulate new strategies. I really feel that practice makes perfect in website design. The more projects that I do the better off I will be in learning how to design.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These next few weeks are about design. This is an area that I don't have a lot of experience in but I hope will teach me a lot.</p>

<p>I can say that reading about design and to a larger extent taking a course about web design/development has opened my mind to examples in everyday life.</p>

<p>One example that continues to irk me is the lack of decently designed mobile restaurant pages in Washington DC. Almost every restaurant website that I have been to recently has redirected me to a mobile site, given me unclear instructions on how to view the full site, not provided a responsive layout, and is generally crap. The sites are ugly, not functional, and usually only three buttons: menu, directions, contact us. Ok so you included menu, that's probably why I am there anyway <click> oh it's just a .pdf that takes forever to download and is out of date? Great. Sigh seriously they are all crap. I wonder if any other cities have this problem.</p>

<p>Now it's back to trying to find dinner on my phone <headdesk>...</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have recently started my web development training at Thinkful and everything is going well! Thinkful is a startup focused on giving more structure to highly motivated learners. Thinkful uses the depth of self-learning HTML, CSS, and javascript resources that MOOCS are providing.</p>

<p>Likely you are having the same reaction as I did. I can already access all of that content myself and a lot of it for free. With quality MOOCS like Treehouse and Code School springing up faster that April flowers, what makes Thinkful different? Or why should I pay for this?</p>

<p>Again Thinkful is focused on 'highly motivated learners'. What they give highly motivated learners is some structure to their learning. Personally I have found that most MOOCS give you a lot of information, exercises, and/or lessons to consume but they don't do a good job leading you down the right path. In contrast Thinkful provides this structure. They give you projects to complete in each Unit. This allows you to really hone the skills you are learning. They also provide Mentors that have industry expertise to help guide you when you get stuck as well as give feedback on your projects. I agree with Thinkful. For me, the highly motivated learner, this is what I need.</p>

<p>I will keep this blog updated as the course goes along. We will see where we are at the end!</p>
